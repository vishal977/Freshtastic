An E-Commerce application built with React and Firebase.


## NPM dependencies

* [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)
* [styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components)
* [react-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-icons)
* [firebase](https://www.npmjs.com/package/firebase)

## CSS
The styling for the application is done with the 'Styled Components' library as it is less clumsy than the traditional method.

## Firebase configuration

Create your Firebase project on the Google Cloud Console. The project needs Firebase Storage and Firestore services, so set them both up according to your requirements. Once that is done, create a `FirebaseConfig.js` file in the `src/firebase/` folder, paste your `firebaseConfig` object in there and export it.
